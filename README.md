# Earthworm-Brain

So from a thought of visualizing a brain, how it stores data how it reacts to the inputs got me into the way of making developing an artificial brain 


Not so surprizingly there are more than 86 billion Neurons in a human brain and much more billions of functionalities 

So I decided to choose Earthworm's brain

And so this is an Earthworm's brain(Artificial)

More like a SNN

It can track the actions in neurons over an input


But still lags the functionilty part like how it responds to the inputs how it should react like its thinking best case and all



So open source contributors are most welcome to come and give your inputs
